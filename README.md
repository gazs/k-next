# things to do

- how to modify body classes, etc
- how to do nicer routing (real permalinks as used on real kinja)
- how to deal with /ajax/inset stuff
- how to deal with image styling (it would be nice to have the DAP to build the post bodies)
- store / load post bodies via serviceworker (when requesting a frontpage, we already have all the data for rendering the post itself)
